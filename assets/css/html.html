        <p>Hi! My name is Becky, and I'm a student at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities Campus; enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp. I love the fast paced environment of the course and the knowledge and the skills I have developed in just the first couple weeks! I am excited for what is to come, and how this will help me in my new career.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My husband, Chris, and I have four kids, Lexi (6), Michael (4) and Ellen and Ethan (2), and I currently run a child care business out of my home. We have a very busy life, which is fun, but also hectic at times, so of course, I decided what better time than now to build a career as a web developer?! :) Check out my portfolio and reach out with any questions or suggestions. Thanks for checking out my page! </p>
